== Imageboard|guestbook template

One day I decided to create a little imageboard

I named it in the honour of Gregg Pollack who inspired me with his awesome ruby on rails guides

For now this is a simple guestbook, that in future should mutate to imageboard. 

Functionality: 

* Create post

* Post could contain text

* Post could contain from field

* Post could contain image
